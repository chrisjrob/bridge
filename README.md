Description
-----------
Designed in OpenSCAD.
Fully parametric, within certain parameters at least.
This is a simple model bridge, printable in a single part, or in three parts for larger bridges.

Status
------
Does not work for all parameters, ramps need improving.
These improvements will probably never be carried out, as I have printed what I needed and unless I find the need to print more bridges, that is probably the end of the development!

Instructions
------------
* Edit SCAD file with the parameters of your clip.
* Compile and export to STL
* Alternatively download the included STL:
  - [bridge.stl](https://github.com/chrisjrob/bridge/blob/master/bridge.stl "Bridge STL"): Bridge STL
* Slice and print
